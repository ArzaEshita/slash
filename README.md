:thought_balloon: Use Case
---
* ***Students***: Students coming to university are generally on a budget and time constraint and generally spend hours wasting time to search for products on Websites. Slash is the perfect tool for these students that slashes all the unnecessary details on a website and helps them get prices for a product across multiple websites.Make the most of this tool in the upcoming Black Friday Sale.
* ***Data Analysts***: Finding data for any project is one of the most tedious job for a data analyst, and the datasets found might not be the most recent one. Using slash, they can create their own dataset in real time and format it as per their needs so that they can focus on what is actually inportant.

:page_facing_up: Why
---
- In a market where we are spoilt for choices, we often look for the best deals.  
- The ubiquity of internet access has leveled the retail playing field, making it easy for individuals and businesses to sell products without geographic limitation. In 2020, U.S. e-commerce sales, receiving a boost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, grew 44% and represented more than 21% of total retail sales, according to e-commerce information source Internet Retailer.
- The growth of e-commerce has not only changed the way customers shop, but also their expectations of how brands approach customer service, personalize communications, and provide customers choices.
- E-commerce market has prompted cut throat competition amongst dealers, which is discernable through the price patterns for products of major market players. Price cuts are somewhat of a norm now and getting the best deal for your money can sometimes be a hassle (even while online shopping).
- This is what Slash aims to reduce by giving you an easy to use, all in one place solution for finding the best deals for your products that major market dealers have to offer!
- Slash in its current form is for people who have some understanding of python and are comfortable in using the command line interface to interact with systems.
- Future updates aim to encompass a wide variety of users irrespective of their computer knowledge and background.

:golf: Future Roadmap
---

- Front End implementation of Slash API , ie., converting it into a full stack web application.
- Chrome Extension using the functionalities of Slash API
- An iOS app or Android application.
